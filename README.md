The first Advent of Code I participated was 2019 in Rust and Go (when I just started programming so the solutions are really bad).
In 2020 I used D, but there are some files that I made some year(s) later.
In 2021 and 2022 I used a combination of Lua, Moonscript, Ruby and Fennel.

Have done but are missing from the repo:
* 2015 11,23
* 2020 1,15
* 2021 16, (17,21,22 1 star)

* Possibly some part 2's
* The other way around, some files exists but the solutions are not complete.
